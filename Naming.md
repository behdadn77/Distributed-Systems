**Question:** *Describe the difference between a flat naming system implemented with a hierarchy of servers and a structured naming system implemented using a similar hierarchy of servers. Compare the two solutions and explain why the latter one is more efficient.*

### Answer:
1. **Flat Naming System**:
   - A flat naming system uses unique names without any hierarchical organization. When implemented with a hierarchy of servers, each name is treated as a random identifier. Name resolution in this system can be inefficient because queries may require contacting multiple servers or broadcasting until the correct resource is found, which is resource-intensive and time-consuming.
  
2. **Structured Naming System**:
   - In a structured naming system, names are organized hierarchically (like file paths or domain names). This structure is mirrored in the hierarchy of servers, where each server is responsible for a segment of the namespace. The name resolution process is streamlined, as queries can be routed directly to the relevant part of the hierarchy, significantly reducing the search time.

### Comparison and Efficiency:
- **Flat Naming System**: Less efficient because lookups can involve multiple server queries or broadcasts, leading to high overhead and poor scalability as the system grows.
- **Structured Naming System**: More efficient, as the hierarchical organization allows for faster lookups by directly narrowing down the search path. It is also more scalable and easier to manage since changes can be isolated to specific parts of the hierarchy.

**Why the Structured System is More Efficient**:
The structured naming system optimizes lookup by using the hierarchy to minimize the search space. Instead of searching broadly, the system directs queries efficiently, saving time and resources and handling large namespaces better than a flat system.
