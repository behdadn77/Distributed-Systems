**Question:** Describe mobile code paradigms with examples.

**Answer:**

### Overview of Mobile Code:
Mobile code refers to the ability to relocate components of a distributed application during runtime. This architecture provides flexibility and adaptability in distributed systems by enabling the movement of code and sometimes the state of execution across different hosts. There are different paradigms depending on where the code originates and where it executes.

### Mobile Code Paradigms:

#### 1. Client-Server Paradigm:
- **Description:** In the client-server model, both the code and execution capabilities are located on the server side. The client simply sends requests and receives processed data or results from the server.
- **Example:** A web application where the client sends data to a server, which processes it and sends back the results. For instance, a database query handled entirely on the server side.

#### 2. Remote Evaluation:
- **Description:** In remote evaluation, the client provides the code, which is then executed on a remote server. The server sends back the evaluated result. This paradigm is powerful but poses security risks because the server executes potentially untrusted code.
- **Example:** PostScript printing is a classic example, where a printer server receives a PostScript file (code) from a client, executes it to render the document, and prints it.
- **Security Concerns:** The server must be protected from malicious code, as it has to execute external instructions.

#### 3. Code on Demand:
- **Description:** In this model, the client requests and downloads code from a server and then executes it locally. The client must be equipped to run the code. This paradigm is common in web technologies.
- **Example:** JavaScript in web browsers. A webpage downloads JavaScript code from a server, which is then executed on the client side to enhance interactivity or provide functionality.
- **Key Consideration:** Clients must have a secure environment to execute the code, as untrusted or poorly written code can be exploited.

#### 4. Mobile Agent:
- **Description:** A mobile agent carries both the code and data. It travels between different hosts to complete execution tasks. The agent can perform partial computations and move to another host to continue or complete the task.
- **Example:** There are no widespread practical examples of mobile agents, but they are theoretically useful in scenarios like distributed information retrieval, where the agent collects and processes data across various locations.
- **Advantages:** Mobile agents can reduce network load by processing data close to its source.

### Mobile Code Technologies:

- **Strong Mobility:**  
  Refers to systems that can move both the code and the execution state to another environment. An example is a mobile agent that carries its state and resumes execution seamlessly on another host. Few systems support this due to complexity.
- **Weak Mobility:**  
  Involves moving code without preserving the execution state. Commonly used in platforms like Java, .Net, and the Web. Examples include remote evaluation and code on demand.

### Advantages of Mobile Code:
- **Flexibility:** Code components can be updated at runtime without halting the system.
- **Enrich Functionality:** Existing components can easily be extended or modified.
- **Service Adapta
