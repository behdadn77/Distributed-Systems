### Answer

#### 1. **Specific Requirements of a Video Streaming Service**

Video streaming services, like those similar to Napster or BitTorrent, require high performance and reliability to provide a seamless user experience. The following requirements often do not fit well with the characteristics of the traditional IP protocol:

1. **Low Latency**:
   - **Requirement**: Video streaming needs to minimize delay to ensure smooth playback without buffering.
   - **IP Protocol Limitation**: The Internet Protocol (IP) does not guarantee low latency because it uses a best-effort delivery model. Packets can take different routes, resulting in variable delay (jitter).

2. **Reliable Data Transfer**:
   - **Requirement**: Video data must be delivered reliably and in order. Packet loss can result in video glitches or missing frames.
   - **IP Protocol Limitation**: IP does not guarantee the delivery or the order of packets. Packet loss and out-of-order delivery are common issues that IP alone does not address.

3. **Efficient Bandwidth Utilization**:
   - **Requirement**: Streaming large video files requires efficient use of available bandwidth to avoid network congestion.
   - **IP Protocol Limitation**: IP does not handle congestion control or optimize bandwidth usage. It relies on higher-level protocols to manage these concerns.

4. **Scalability**:
   - **Requirement**: The service should handle a large number of simultaneous users efficiently, without degrading performance.
   - **IP Protocol Limitation**: IP does not provide mechanisms for load balancing or efficient distribution of data to multiple recipients.

### 2. **Mechanisms to Address IP Protocol Limitations**

To build a robust and scalable video streaming service, you can implement several mechanisms that work around the limitations of the IP protocol:

1. **Using a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model (Similar to Napster or BitTorrent)**
   - **Mechanism**: Distribute video data across multiple peers rather than relying on a single central server. Each peer can download and upload video segments, spreading the load and improving scalability.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Reduces the load on central servers.
     - Enhances bandwidth efficiency by allowing data to be shared directly between users.
     - Increases resilience to failures, as data can be retrieved from multiple sources.

2. **Implementing Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**
   - **Mechanism**: Use a CDN to cache video content at servers distributed across various geographic locations. This reduces latency by serving data from a location closer to the user.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Lowers latency and jitter.
     - Improves reliability and speeds up data transfer by distributing the content more evenly.
  
3. **Using Application-Level Protocols (e.g., UDP-based Streaming)**
   - **Mechanism**: Instead of relying on TCP (which can introduce latency due to its congestion control mechanisms), use protocols like **UDP** for real-time video streaming. Combine UDP with techniques such as Forward Error Correction (FEC) to handle packet loss.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Reduced latency and smoother playback.
     - Graceful handling of packet loss without retransmission delays.

4. **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR)**
   - **Mechanism**: Dynamically adjust the video quality based on the user's current network conditions. If bandwidth decreases, the service switches to a lower bitrate to avoid buffering.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Maintains a consistent playback experience.
     - Optimizes bandwidth usage and minimizes buffering.

5. **Using Overlay Networks**
   - **Mechanism**: Create an overlay network where nodes strategically forward video data based on network conditions and user locations. This can help manage traffic and improve the reliability of data delivery.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Reduces congestion and latency.
     - Enhances control over data routing compared to the underlying IP network.

### Conclusion

Video streaming services require solutions that address the inherent limitations of the IP protocol, such as variable latency, unreliable delivery, and inefficient bandwidth usage. Mechanisms like peer-to-peer networking, CDNs, UDP-based streaming, and adaptive bitrate streaming can greatly enhance the performance and scalability of a video streaming platform. The choice of mechanisms depends on the specific requirements of your service and the target user base.
