### Answer
#### 1. **Specific Requirements of a Video Streaming Service**

When designing a video streaming service, there are several critical requirements that do not align well with the inherent characteristics of the IP protocol:

1. **Low Latency**:
   - **Requirement**: Streaming must have minimal delays to provide a smooth user experience, avoiding buffering and lag.
   - **IP Protocol Limitation**: The IP protocol uses a best-effort delivery model, which does not prioritize low latency. Packet delays are common and can vary significantly.

2. **Reliable Data Transfer**:
   - **Requirement**: Video data should be delivered reliably, ensuring minimal frame drops and high-quality playback.
   - **IP Protocol Limitation**: IP does not guarantee the delivery or the order of packets. Packet loss and out-of-order delivery can result in missing frames or choppy video.

3. **Efficient Bandwidth Management**:
   - **Requirement**: Streaming large video files requires efficient use of available bandwidth to maintain video quality and prevent network congestion.
   - **IP Protocol Limitation**: IP does not have built-in mechanisms for congestion control or bandwidth optimization, which are necessary for high-quality streaming.

4. **Scalability**:
   - **Requirement**: The service should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users, distributing video content efficiently to minimize load and prevent service degradation.
   - **IP Protocol Limitation**: IP alone cannot efficiently handle large-scale data distribution, and it lacks built-in load balancing or distribution capabilities.

### 2. **Mechanisms to Address IP Protocol Limitations**

To implement a robust video streaming service, you can use several techniques and technologies to overcome these limitations:

1. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**
   - **Mechanism**: Use CDNs to cache and distribute video content from servers located strategically across different regions. Users are served content from the closest CDN server, reducing latency and improving speed.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Minimizes latency by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user.
     - Enhances reliability by distributing load and preventing single points of failure.

2. **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR)**
   - **Mechanism**: Implement adaptive bitrate streaming protocols, such as **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)** or **MPEG-DASH**, which adjust the quality of the video stream in real-time based on the user’s current network conditions.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Optimizes video playback by ensuring smooth streaming even when bandwidth fluctuates.
     - Reduces buffering by dynamically lowering video quality when the network is congested.

3. **Using UDP for Real-Time Streaming**
   - **Mechanism**: Instead of TCP, use **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**, which allows for faster data transmission since it does not require acknowledgment of each packet. Combine UDP with error correction techniques to manage packet loss.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Reduces latency and provides smoother playback, as UDP is less concerned with retransmission delays.
     - Useful for live streaming or time-sensitive content where a small amount of data loss is acceptable.

4. **Error Correction and Recovery Techniques**
   - **Mechanism**: Use **Forward Error Correction (FEC)** or similar mechanisms to handle packet loss. FEC adds redundant data to the stream, allowing the receiver to reconstruct lost packets without needing retransmissions.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Maintains video quality by preventing noticeable errors in the playback.
     - Reduces the need for retransmission, which can introduce delays.

5. **Load Balancing and Distributed Servers**
   - **Mechanism**: Deploy multiple servers and use load balancers to distribute incoming user requests evenly across the network. Load balancing ensures that no single server is overwhelmed, enhancing service reliability.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Increases scalability and maintains high performance even under heavy loads.
     - Improves fault tolerance by redistributing traffic if a server fails.

6. **Quality of Service (QoS) Mechanisms**
   - **Mechanism**: Implement QoS techniques to prioritize video streaming traffic over less critical data on the network. This ensures that video packets are delivered in a timely manner.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Reduces latency and packet loss for critical video data.
     - Enhances the overall user experience by ensuring high-priority delivery of video streams.

### Conclusion

The IP protocol’s limitations, such as unpredictable latency, lack of reliability, and inefficient bandwidth management, can be mitigated using CDNs, adaptive bitrate streaming, UDP, and error correction techniques. These mechanisms ensure high-quality, scalable, and low-latency video streaming, addressing the specific demands of a modern streaming service.
