### Answer

#### 1. **Using Vector Clocks for Causal Ordering**

**Vector clocks** are an extension of scalar clocks that can fully capture the causality relationship between events in a distributed system. They are used to ensure that messages are delivered in an order that respects causal relationships, which is crucial for maintaining consistency in systems like distributed bulletin boards or replicated databases.

##### **How Vector Clocks Work:**
1. **Definition and Initialization**:
   - Each process \( P_i \) maintains a **vector clock** \( V_i \), which is an array of size \( N \) (where \( N \) is the number of processes in the system).
   - \( V_i[j] \) represents the number of events that process \( P_i \) knows have occurred at process \( P_j \).

2. **Rules for Updating Vector Clocks**:
   - **Local Event**: When a process \( P_i \) executes a local event, it increments \( V_i[i] \) by 1.
   - **Message Sending**: Before sending a message, \( P_i \) increments \( V_i[i] \) and attaches the entire vector clock \( V_i \) to the message.
   - **Message Receiving**: When \( P_i \) receives a message from \( P_j \) with a timestamp \( t \):
     - \( V_i[k] = \max(V_i[k], t[k]) \) for all \( k \neq i \).
     - Then \( P_i \) increments \( V_i[i] \).

##### **Determining Causality**:
- To determine if event \( e \) causally precedes event \( e' \), we check their vector timestamps:
  \[
  V(e) < V(e') \iff V(e)[j] \leq V(e')[j] \text{ for all } j \text{ and } V(e) \neq V(e')
  \]
- If \( V(e) \) and \( V(e') \) are not related in this way, the events are **concurrent** (denoted as \( e || e' \)).

### 2. **Ensuring Causal Delivery**
Vector clocks are used to guarantee **causal ordering** in message delivery. Specifically, if event \( e \) causally precedes event \( e' \), then all processes must deliver \( e \) before \( e' \).

- **Implementation**:
  - A message \( m \) is only delivered to the application if all causally preceding messages have already been delivered.
  - This is achieved by checking the vector clock of the incoming message against the process's current vector clock. If the vector clock conditions are satisfied, the message is delivered; otherwise, it is held until the required messages are received.

- **Example**: Consider a message \( MSG \) sent from \( P_1 \) and a reply \( REPLY \) sent from \( P_2 \). To ensure causal delivery, \( REPLY \) must only be delivered after \( MSG \) has been delivered to all processes.

### 3. **Handling Dynamic Membership (Process Changes at Runtime)**

If the set of processes changes at runtime (e.g., new processes join or existing processes leave), maintaining causal ordering using vector clocks becomes more complex but is still possible with some modifications.

#### **Challenges with Dynamic Membership**:
1. **Vector Clock Size**: The size of the vector clock depends on the number of processes \( N \). When a new process joins or an existing one leaves, the vector clock structure must be adjusted.
2. **State Synchronization**: Newly joined processes need to synchronize with the current state of the system, which includes updating their vector clock and learning about any pending messages.

#### **Solutions for Dynamic Membership**:
1. **Adding a New Process**:
   - When a new process \( P_{new} \) joins the system, all existing processes update their vector clocks to accommodate the new entry, increasing the size of the clock vector by 1.
   - \( P_{new} \) initializes its vector clock with all entries set to 0 and synchronizes with one or more existing processes to learn the current state of the system, including any messages that need to be causally delivered.
   - All processes broadcast an update indicating the new membership, ensuring everyone adjusts their vector clocks consistently.

2. **Handling Process Departures**:
   - If a process \( P_i \) leaves, the vector clock entries associated with \( P_i \) can either be ignored or compacted, depending on the system's design.
   - If compacting, all remaining processes need to synchronize to ensure that the vector clocks are updated uniformly, and causality is preserved.

3. **View Changes**:
   - Implementing **view changes** (similar to virtual synchrony) helps manage dynamic membership. A view change ensures that all processes agree on the membership before resuming normal operations.
   - During a view change, vector clocks are adjusted, and any necessary state synchronization is performed.

### 4. **Conclusion**
Vector clocks effectively guarantee causal ordering among a fixed set of known processes. If the set of processes might change at runtime, the system can still maintain causal ordering by dynamically adjusting the size of the vector clocks and using synchronization mechanisms to integrate new processes or handle departures. While this adds complexity, it ensures that the causal relationships between events are preserved even in a dynamic distributed environment.
