### Answer

#### 1. **Concept of Virtual Synchrony**
Virtual synchrony is a communication model used in distributed systems to ensure that all group members have a consistent view of the sequence of events, even in the presence of failures. This model is especially useful in systems that require coordinated actions, such as fault-tolerant replication and group communication.

The core idea of virtual synchrony is to guarantee that all members of a process group see the same sequence of messages and view changes (e.g., when members join or leave the group). Even if a process crashes or network failures occur, all non-faulty members maintain a consistent state and agree on the messages that were delivered before the group membership changed.

### 2. **Implementation of Virtual Synchrony**

One of the well-known implementations of virtual synchrony is in the ISIS system, which ensures message consistency and reliable communication between group members. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Message Transmission and Stability**:
   - Messages are sent using **reliable and FIFO point-to-point channels**, which ensure that messages are delivered in the order they were sent, but do not guarantee that all group members will receive the message if the sender crashes.
   - A message is considered **stable** when it is confirmed that all members of the current group view have received it. Until stability is confirmed, processes buffer the message.

2. **View Changes**:
   - A **view change** occurs when the membership of the group changes, such as when a process fails or a new one joins. A distributed component handles view change notifications.
   - Upon receiving a view change notification, each process:
     - Stops sending new messages.
     - Multicasts all pending, unstable messages to the remaining members of the old view to ensure everyone has the same set of messages.
     - Marks these messages as stable and sends a **flush message** to indicate that it is ready to install the new view.
   - A process can only install the new view after receiving a flush message from every other process in the new view.

3. **Steps in the Protocol**:
   - **Step 1**: A process detects a change (e.g., another process crashes) and initiates a view change.
   - **Step 2**: Each non-faulty process sends its unstable messages to the group and then a flush message.
   - **Step 3**: Once all flush messages are received, each process installs the new view and resumes normal operations.

### 3. **Assumptions for Correctness**
1. **Reliable Communication**: The protocol assumes that messages between non-faulty processes are delivered reliably and in FIFO order.
2. **Synchronous Notifications**: The system assumes that processes are notified about view changes in a timely and consistent manner.
3. **Failure Model**: The protocol handles **crash failures** (where processes may stop functioning) but not Byzantine failures (where processes may act maliciously or unpredictably).
4. **Membership Stability**: During the execution of the view change protocol, it is assumed that the group membership does not change further until the new view is installed. The protocol can be extended to handle concurrent membership changes.

### 4. **Example Scenario**
Imagine a distributed system where multiple servers replicate a data store and need to stay in sync:
- If a server crashes, the remaining servers use virtual synchrony to ensure that all pending data updates are consistently applied before acknowledging the membership change.
- New updates are only processed after the view change is completed, ensuring a consistent state among all active servers.

### Conclusion
Virtual synchrony ensures that all non-faulty members of a distributed system maintain a consistent view of messages and membership changes. The protocol relies on reliable communication, timely view change notifications, and crash failure handling to guarantee correctness. This approach is essential for applications requiring strong coordination and fault tolerance, such as distributed databases and replicated services.
