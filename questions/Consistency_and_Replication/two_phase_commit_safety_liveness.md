**Question:** *Consider the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol. Which problem does it solve? Does the protocol guarantee safety (correctness) and liveness (does not block)? If not, present a situation in which the protocol might lead to incorrect results.*

### Answer

#### 1. **Problem Solved by Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol**
   - **Consistency Across Distributed Systems**:
     - The 2PC protocol is used to ensure **atomicity** in distributed transactions, meaning either all operations across distributed nodes are committed, or none are, ensuring a consistent state across the system.
     - It is particularly useful when multiple nodes participate in a transaction that requires agreement to commit or abort.

#### 2. **Phases of the Protocol**
   - **Phase 1: Prepare Phase**
     - The **coordinator** sends a "prepare" request to all participating nodes.
     - Each node checks if it can commit the transaction. If yes, it votes "yes" and prepares to commit; otherwise, it votes "no."

   - **Phase 2: Commit/Abort Phase**
     - If all nodes vote "yes," the coordinator sends a "commit" request, and all nodes commit the transaction.
     - If any node votes "no," the coordinator sends an "abort" request, and all nodes abort the transaction.

#### 3. **Safety (Correctness)**
   - **Guaranteed**:
     - The 2PC protocol ensures **safety** because:
       - Nodes commit only after receiving a definitive decision (commit or abort) from the coordinator.
       - Once a node commits, it does not roll back, maintaining a consistent global state.

#### 4. **Liveness (Does Not Block)**
   - **Not Guaranteed**:
     - 2PC can block under certain conditions, as it relies on the availability of the coordinator.
     - If the coordinator fails during the commit phase (after some nodes commit and others are undecided), the undecided nodes cannot proceed, resulting in blocking.

---

#### 5. **Situation Where 2PC Fails to Guarantee Liveness**
   - **Scenario**: Coordinator Failure During Commit Phase
     1. A transaction is initiated, and all participating nodes vote "yes" during the prepare phase.
     2. The coordinator sends a "commit" message to some nodes but fails (e.g., due to a crash) before informing all nodes.
     3. **Result**:
        - Nodes that received the "commit" message commit the transaction.
        - Nodes that did not receive the "commit" message remain in the prepared state, waiting indefinitely for the coordinator's decision.
   - **Impact**:
     - The system is now in an inconsistent state: some nodes have committed, and others are undecided, leading to a **blocked state** for the undecided nodes.

---

#### 6. **Conclusion**
   - The 2PC protocol solves the problem of ensuring atomicity and consistency in distributed transactions.
   - While it guarantees **safety** by preventing inconsistent states, it does **not guarantee liveness**, as a failure in the coordinator can lead to blocking situations.
   - This limitation highlights the trade-offs in distributed systems and has led to the development of advanced protocols like **Three-Phase Commit (3PC)** to address the blocking issue.
