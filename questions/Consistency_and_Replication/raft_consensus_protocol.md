### Answer

#### 1. **Problem Solved by Raft Consensus Protocol**
   - The **Raft Consensus Protocol** is designed to solve the **distributed consensus problem**, where multiple nodes in a distributed system must agree on a single, consistent value (e.g., the order of operations in a replicated state machine).
   - Raft ensures:
     - **Consistency**: All non-faulty nodes agree on the same value or sequence of operations.
     - **Fault Tolerance**: The protocol can tolerate failures of up to half of the nodes in the system (majority quorum is required).

#### 2. **Assumptions of the Protocol**
   - **Reliable Message Delivery**: Messages may be delayed or reordered but will eventually be delivered.
   - **Crash Recovery**: Nodes may fail and later recover with their stable storage intact.
   - **Majority Availability**: The system assumes that a majority of the nodes are operational at any given time.
   - **Synchronous Intervals**: While Raft operates in asynchronous systems, it assumes periodic intervals of synchrony where messages are delivered within predictable time bounds.

#### 3. **Guarantees of Raft Protocol**
   - **Safety (Correctness)**:
     - Raft guarantees **safety** under all conditions, including node crashes or message delays.
     - Key mechanisms ensuring safety:
       - **Leader Election**: Only one leader is allowed at a time, avoiding conflicts.
       - **Log Matching Property**: All committed entries are consistent across all nodes.
       - **Commit Rules**: Entries are committed only when a majority acknowledges them.
       - Raftâ€™s design avoids split-brain scenarios by ensuring that only the leader with the most up-to-date log can successfully append entries.

   - **Liveness (Progress)**:
     - **Liveness is not guaranteed** during certain failure scenarios.
     - Example:
       - In cases of **network partitions**, Raft may fail to elect a leader if a majority quorum cannot be established. Without a leader, the protocol cannot make progress until the partition is resolved.
       - If timers are misconfigured or there are frequent leader crashes, the system may experience delays in electing a new leader.

#### 4. **Scenario Demonstrating Lack of Liveness**
   - **Network Partition**:
     - Assume a cluster of 5 nodes. If a network partition isolates 3 nodes from 2 nodes:
       - The group of 3 nodes can still elect a leader and make progress (if they have a majority).
       - The group of 2 nodes will be unable to elect a leader, leading to a halt in operations for that subset.
       - If the partition persists, Raft may fail to achieve liveness for the entire system, as the minority group remains blocked.

   - **Leader Crash with Network Instability**:
     - If a leader crashes and network instability causes delays in reaching a quorum for leader election, the system remains blocked until a new leader is successfully elected.

#### 5. **Conclusion**
   - Raft addresses the distributed consensus problem by providing **safety guarantees** under all conditions.
   - **Liveness** is not always guaranteed, as the protocol may block during network partitions or if a majority of nodes are unavailable.
   - These trade-offs are inherent in distributed systems due to the **CAP theorem**, where Raft prioritizes **Consistency** over **Availability** during failures.
