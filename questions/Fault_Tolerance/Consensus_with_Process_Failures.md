**Question:** *Consider N servers that receive reimbursement requests. Periodically they have to agree on the total number of reimbursements accepted. Suppose the system is synchronous and communication is reliable. Is it possible to reach consensus if processes may fail? How many non-faulty processes are needed to reach such consensus? Which distributed algorithm among those you studied would you use to reach it? Provide a brief description of the algorithm.*

### Answer

#### 1. **Is Consensus Possible in a Synchronous System with Process Failures?**
Yes, consensus is possible in a synchronous system with reliable communication, even when some processes may fail. The key is to ensure that there are enough non-faulty processes to make decisions collectively, despite some failures.

---

### 2. **Number of Non-Faulty Processes Needed**
To achieve consensus in a synchronous system with **crash failures** (where processes may stop functioning but do not behave maliciously), we need:
\[
N \geq f + 1
\]
where \( f \) is the maximum number of processes that can fail. This requirement ensures that there are always enough non-faulty processes to reach a decision, even in the worst-case scenario of \( f \) failures.

### 3. **Distributed Algorithm: Simple Majority Agreement Algorithm**

Since we are considering a synchronous system, a simple agreement algorithm can be employed. Hereâ€™s how it works:

#### **Description of the Simple Majority Agreement Algorithm**
1. **Initial Setup**: Each process starts with its initial value, which, in this case, is the count of reimbursement requests it has accepted.
2. **Communication Round**:
   - Each process sends its current value to every other process. Given the synchronous nature of the system, all messages are guaranteed to be received within a known time frame.
3. **Aggregation Phase**:
   - Each process collects the values from all other processes, including its own. It then computes the total number of reimbursements by summing up these values.
4. **Decision Phase**:
   - Each non-faulty process uses the aggregated total to reach a consensus on the number of accepted reimbursements. Since all processes perform this step in the same way and have the same set of values (from reliable communication), they all agree on the same result.

---

### 4. **Assumptions for the Algorithm to Work**
1. **Synchronous System**: The algorithm relies on the assumption that all messages are delivered within a known, bounded time frame.
2. **Reliable Communication**: Messages between processes cannot be lost or delayed beyond the defined bounds.
3. **Crash Failures Only**: The algorithm can tolerate processes that crash and stop working but not processes that act maliciously or send incorrect information.

---

### 5. **Comparison with a Centralized Server Approach**
1. **Centralized Server Approach**:
   - **Description**: A single server gathers all values, computes the total, and then broadcasts the result to all processes.
   - **Traffic Generated**: Every process sends its value to the central server, which then sends the total back to all processes. This results in \( 2N \) messages.
   - **Assumptions**: The central server must be highly reliable and must not crash, as it is a single point of failure.

2. **Simple Majority Agreement Algorithm**:
   - **Traffic Generated**: Each process sends its value to every other process, resulting in \( N \times (N - 1) \) messages in total. While this is more communication overhead, it distributes the load evenly and does not have a single point of failure.
   - **Assumptions**: The system can tolerate up to \( f \) crash failures as long as \( N \geq f + 1 \).

---

### Conclusion
In a synchronous distributed system with reliable communication and potential crash failures, a **Simple Majority Agreement Algorithm** ensures that consensus is reached. This algorithm relies on each process communicating with all others, aggregating values, and agreeing on a total, without needing a centralized server. It is straightforward, robust in the presence of crash failures, and ensures all non-faulty processes reach the same decision.
