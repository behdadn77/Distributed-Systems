# Distributed Systems Exam Preparation

This repository is a collection of answers to commonly asked questions from past Distributed Systems exams. The answers were primarily generated using GPT-4o and refined using references from the course textbook to ensure accuracy and alignment with the material taught by the professor.

## Structure of the Repository

- **Questions and Answers**: Each question from past exams has a corresponding answer provided in this repository. The answers aim to be comprehensive yet concise, making it easier for students to review and understand key concepts in Distributed Systems.
- **Reference Material**: The `res` folder contains an **unofficial course textbook**, specifically named **FINAL - DS notes col.pdf**, which serves as a reference for providing accurate and professor-aligned responses. This text is crucial for ensuring that explanations and terminologies are consistent with what has been covered in the course.
