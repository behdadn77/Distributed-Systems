Question: Describe pub/sub in general and the difference with RPC. Then explain how a generic DHT can be used to implement a distributed dispatching service. Which is the main limitation of this approach?

Answer:
Pub/Sub Overview:

Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) is a messaging pattern where senders (publishers) and receivers (subscribers) are decoupled. Publishers send messages without knowing who the subscribers are, and subscribers receive messages without knowing who the publishers are. The communication is managed by an intermediary (e.g., a message broker) that handles message distribution based on topics or event types.
Key Characteristics:
Decoupling: Publishers and subscribers are not aware of each other, which provides flexibility and scalability.
Asynchronous Communication: Messages are sent and received asynchronously, promoting loose coupling in distributed systems.
Difference Between Pub/Sub and RPC:

RPC (Remote Procedure Call):
In RPC, a client directly calls a method on a remote server, expecting a response. The communication is synchronous, and the caller needs to know the address of the remote service.
Tight Coupling: The client and server are tightly coupled because the client must be aware of the serverâ€™s interface and address.
Pub/Sub:
The communication is indirect and event-driven. Publishers do not wait for responses from subscribers, and the system can handle many-to-many communication more efficiently.
Loose Coupling: Pub/Sub decouples components, allowing them to operate independently.
Summary: The main difference lies in the communication model: RPC is synchronous and tightly coupled, while Pub/Sub is asynchronous and loosely coupled.

Using a Generic DHT for Distributed Dispatching:

Distributed Hash Table (DHT):
A DHT is a decentralized structure that maps keys to values across multiple nodes. It provides efficient lookup operations and is commonly used in peer-to-peer networks.
Implementing a Distributed Dispatching Service:
In a Pub/Sub system, a generic DHT can be used to store and manage subscriptions. Topics or event types are hashed to specific keys, and the associated subscribers are stored in the nodes responsible for those keys.
Message Dispatching: When a message is published for a particular topic, the DHT is used to efficiently locate the subscribers and forward the message to them.
Advantages:
Scalability: The DHT structure distributes the load evenly across nodes, making it scalable and efficient for large systems.
Efficient Lookups: The hash-based mechanism ensures that messages can be dispatched quickly to the relevant subscribers.
Main Limitation of Using DHT for Dispatching:

Lack of Advanced Filtering: DHTs are primarily designed for key-based lookups and do not support complex queries or content-based filtering. Subscribers can only register for exact topics, limiting the flexibility of the dispatching service.
Event Ordering: Ensuring message order and consistency in delivery can be challenging due to the distributed nature of DHTs.
Network Dynamics: DHTs are sensitive to changes in network topology (e.g., nodes joining or leaving), which can impact message reliability and introduce delays or missed messages.
